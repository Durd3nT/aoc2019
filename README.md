### Advent of Code 2019

My solutions to AoC2019 - This was (is) simply about solving the problems rather than writing highly optimized code.

Numbered directories contain the solutions for the respective day in the calendar.
The directory [./src](./src) contains the Intcode-interpreter developed and refactored throughout the entire problem series (roughly every second day).
